Computer Vision Task: Background Subtraction

Model Name: U2-Net

Model Architecture: U2-Net (U-square Net) Architecture

Description:
U2-Net is a deep learning model specifically designed for salient object detection. It excels in detecting and segmenting salient objects in images by utilizing a U-shaped architecture with nested U-blocks. This design allows for efficient feature extraction and integration at multiple scales, making U^2-Net highly effective for fine-grained object segmentation tasks.

Metrics:

    - Accuracy (F-measure): 91.5%
    - Precision: 92.1%
    - Recall: 91.0%
    - F1 Score: 91.5%
    - Inference Time: 20 ms per image on NVIDIA GTX 1080

Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: PyTorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Pillow, Matplotlib
    - Hardware Requirements: GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1080 or similar recommended), CPU

Limitations:
    - Performance may degrade on images with very complex backgrounds or low contrast between the object and background.
    - Requires a GPU for optimal performance and real-time inference.
    - The model's performance is dependent on the quality and diversity of the training data.
