    "description": "U2-Net is a deep learning model specifically designed for salient object detection. It excels in detecting and segmenting salient objects in images by utilizing a U-shaped architecture with nested U-blocks. This design allows for efficient feature extraction and integration at multiple scales, making U^2-Net highly effective for fine-grained object segmentation tasks.",
