    "description": "The Keras Keypoint Detection Model is designed to identify and localize specific points of interest within an image, such as facial landmarks, body joints, or other key features. This model typically uses a convolutional neural network to learn spatial hierarchies and features necessary for accurate keypoint detection. The architecture can be customized or based on pre-trained models like MobileNet, ResNet, or other CNN architectures fine-tuned for keypoint detection tasks.",
