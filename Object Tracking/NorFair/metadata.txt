Computer Vision Task: Object Tracking

Algorithm Name: Norfair

Algorithm Type: Object Tracking

Description:
Norfair is an object tracking algorithm designed to track objects of interest across consecutive frames in a video sequence. It employs a combination of techniques such as object detection, motion estimation, and data association to maintain the identity of objects over time. Norfair aims to provide robust and real-time tracking performance, making it suitable for applications such as surveillance, video analysis, and augmented reality.

Metrics:
Tracking Accuracy: Depends on the specific application and tracking scenario.
Frames per Second (FPS): 30-60 FPS (on standard video resolutions)

Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
    - Hardware Requirements: CPU

Limitations:
    - Performance may degrade in challenging scenarios such as occlusions, fast motion, or changes in lighting conditions.
    - Accuracy can vary based on the quality of the object detection and motion estimation modules.
    - May require fine-tuning of parameters for optimal performance on different types of videos and objects.
