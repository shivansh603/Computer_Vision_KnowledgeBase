    "description": "Norfair is an object tracking algorithm designed to track objects of interest across consecutive frames in a video sequence. It employs a combination of techniques such as object detection, motion estimation, and data association to maintain the identity of objects over time. Norfair aims to provide robust and real-time tracking performance, making it suitable for applications such as surveillance, video analysis, and augmented reality.",
