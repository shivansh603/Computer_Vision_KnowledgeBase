    "name": "Object Tracking",
    "description": "Object tracking is a computer vision technique used to follow the movement of objects across consecutive video frames. It is crucial in applications such as video surveillance, human-computer interaction, and sports analytics. Popular methods include traditional techniques like Kalman filters, particle filters, and correlation-based tracking, as well as modern deep learning approaches such as Siamese networks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).",
    "usecase": "Used in surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles, and sports analysis.",
    "challenges": "Challenges include occlusion, object appearance changes, and handling multiple objects.",
    "popular_methods": "Common methods include Kalman filters, particle filters, and deep learning-based approaches."
