    "model_name": "MotionDetector",
    "description": "The MotionDetector class is a computer vision model designed to detect motion in video streams using contour detection techniques. It employs a frame differencing approach combined with contour analysis to identify and track moving objects in real-time. The model utilizes OpenCV for image processing and video capture.",

    "dependencies": {
        "software_dependencies": "OpenCV (cv2), NumPy",
        "hardware_requirements": "Camera or video source"
    },
    "limitations": "Performance may degrade in low-light conditions or scenes with complex backgrounds.\nAccuracy may be affected by the choice of parameters, such as the threshold and minimum contour area.\nThe model may struggle with detecting and tracking multiple objects simultaneously.\nComputational complexity increases with higher frame rates and video resolutions.",
