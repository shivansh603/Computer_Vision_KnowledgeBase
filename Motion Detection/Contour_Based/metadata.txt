Computer Vision Task: Motion Detection

Model Name: MotionDetector

Model Architecture: Contour-based Motion Detection

Description: The MotionDetector class is a computer vision model designed to detect motion in video streams using contour detection techniques. It employs a frame differencing approach combined with contour analysis to identify and track moving objects in real-time. The model utilizes OpenCV for image processing and video capture.

Metrics:

Dependencies:
Software Dependencies: OpenCV (cv2), NumPy
Hardware Requirements: Camera or video source

Limitations:
Performance may degrade in low-light conditions or scenes with complex backgrounds.
Accuracy may be affected by the choice of parameters, such as the threshold and minimum contour area.
The model may struggle with detecting and tracking multiple objects simultaneously.
Computational complexity increases with higher frame rates and video resolutions.
