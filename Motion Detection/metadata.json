    "name": "Motion Detection",
    "description": "Motion detection is a technique in computer vision used to identify and track movement within a video sequence. \n It is crucial in applications such as video surveillance, activity recognition, and human-computer interaction.\n Popular methods include background subtraction algorithms, optical flow techniques, and deep learning-based approaches like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).",
    "usecase": "Used in video surveillance, traffic monitoring, and security systems.",
    "challenges": "Challenges include differentiating between relevant motion and noise, handling shadows, and robustness to changing environmental conditions.",
    "popular_methods": "Common methods include frame differencing, background subtraction, and optical flow-based approaches.",
