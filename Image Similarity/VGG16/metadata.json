    "description": "VGG16, originally proposed for image classification, can also be repurposed for image similarity tasks through fine-tuning or feature extraction. By leveraging the deep representations learned by VGG16 on large-scale image datasets, such as ImageNet, and fine-tuning the model on a similarity task-specific dataset, it can effectively capture semantic similarities between images. This approach is commonly used in content-based image retrieval systems, where the goal is to retrieve images similar to a given query image.",

    "limitations": "- Performance heavily relies on the quality and representativeness of the fine-tuning dataset.\n- Limited ability to capture fine-grained similarities due to the coarse feature representations learned by VGG16.\n- May require substantial computational resources for training and inference, especially when fine-tuning on large-scale datasets.",
