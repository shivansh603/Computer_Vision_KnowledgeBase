    "description": "Brightness Preserving Histogram Equalization (BBHE) is an image enhancement algorithm designed to improve the contrast of an image while preserving its mean brightness. Unlike traditional histogram equalization, which can lead to significant brightness shifts, BBHE divides the histogram into two parts based on the mean brightness and equalizes them separately. This approach ensures that the enhanced image maintains a natural appearance, making BBHE suitable for applications such as medical imaging, photography, and real-time video processing.",
