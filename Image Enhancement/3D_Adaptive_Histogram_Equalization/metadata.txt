Computer Vision Task: 3D Image Enhancement

Model Name: 3D Adaptive Histogram Equalization

Model Architecture: Histogram Equalization Algorithm (Adapted for 3D Data)

Description:
3D Adaptive Histogram Equalization is an extension of traditional 2D histogram equalization techniques to three-dimensional (3D) image data. It aims to enhance the contrast and visibility of structures in volumetric medical images, such as CT scans and MRI volumes. By considering the spatial relationships within a 3D image volume, this method addresses the challenges of uneven illumination and low contrast commonly encountered in medical imaging. 3D Adaptive Histogram Equalization is widely used in medical image analysis for tasks like tumor detection, organ segmentation, and disease diagnosis.

Metrics:
    - Contrast Improvement Index: 1.4 (average improvement in visual contrast over baseline)
    - Structural Similarity Index (SSI): 0.85 (higher is better; indicates preservation of image structure)

Computational Time: 5-10 seconds per volume on standard CPU

Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, SimpleITK (for medical image processing), Matplotlib
    - Hardware Requirements: CPU

Limitations:
    - Performance may degrade on volumes with extreme intensity variations or very low contrast.
    - The computational cost can be significant for large 3D volumes, especially with high-resolution medical scans.
    - Careful parameter tuning is required to balance contrast enhancement and preservation of image details.
