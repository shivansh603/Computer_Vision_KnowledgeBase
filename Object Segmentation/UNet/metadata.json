    "description": "U-Net is a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for image segmentation tasks. It features a symmetric encoder-decoder structure with skip connections that bridge corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder paths. This design allows U-Net to capture both high-level semantic information and fine-grained details, making it highly effective for segmenting objects with complex shapes and varying sizes. U-Net is widely used in medical imaging, satellite image analysis, and other applications requiring precise delineation of objects.",
