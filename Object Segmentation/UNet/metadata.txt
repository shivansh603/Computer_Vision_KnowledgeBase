Computer Vision Task: Image Segmentation

Model Name: U-Net

Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Encoder-Decoder Structure

Description:
U-Net is a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for image segmentation tasks. It features a symmetric encoder-decoder structure with skip connections that bridge corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder paths. This design allows U-Net to capture both high-level semantic information and fine-grained details, making it highly effective for segmenting objects with complex shapes and varying sizes. U-Net is widely used in medical imaging, satellite image analysis, and other applications requiring precise delineation of objects.

Metrics:
    - Dice Coefficient: 0.85 (higher is better; indicates overlap between predicted and ground truth segments)
    - Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU): 0.75 (on standard benchmark datasets)

Computational Time: 50-100 ms per image on NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU

Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
    - Hardware Requirements: GPU (NVIDIA Tesla V100 or similar recommended), CPU

Limitations:
    - Performance can degrade on images with significant noise or artifacts.
    - Requires substantial computational resources for training, especially on large datasets.
    - May need extensive hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation for optimal performance on specific tasks.
