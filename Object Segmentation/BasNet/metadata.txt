Computer Vision Task: Object Segmentation

Model Name: BASNet (Boundary-Aware Salient Object Detection Network)

Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Boundary-Awareness

Description:
BASNet is designed for salient object detection, focusing on accurately segmenting objects from the background by incorporating boundary-awareness into its network architecture. BASNet uses a combination of a U-Net-like architecture for capturing spatial hierarchies and an additional boundary-enhancement module to refine the object boundaries. This approach ensures precise segmentation, making BASNet suitable for applications such as image editing, medical imaging, and autonomous driving.

Metrics:
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.047 (lower is better)
    - F-measure: 0.879 (higher is better; indicates accuracy of segmentation)

Computational Time: 50-100 ms per image on NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU

Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
    - Hardware Requirements: GPU (NVIDIA Tesla V100 or similar recommended), CPU

Limitations:
    - High computational and memory requirements for training and inference.
    - Performance may degrade on images with complex backgrounds or low contrast between object and background.
    - Requires large, annotated datasets for optimal training.
