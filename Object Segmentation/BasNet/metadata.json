    "description": "BASNet is designed for salient object detection, focusing on accurately segmenting objects from the background by incorporating boundary-awareness into its network architecture. BASNet uses a combination of a U-Net-like architecture for capturing spatial hierarchies and an additional boundary-enhancement module to refine the object boundaries. This approach ensures precise segmentation, making BASNet suitable for applications such as image editing, medical imaging, and autonomous driving.",
