    "description": "DeepLabv3+ is an advanced semantic segmentation model that builds on the DeepLabv3 architecture by incorporating an encoder-decoder structure. It uses atrous (dilated) convolutions to capture multi-scale contextual information and an encoder-decoder setup to refine segmentation boundaries. The encoder extracts rich feature representations, while the decoder improves the object boundaries and localization. This architecture excels in segmenting objects in images with high accuracy, making it ideal for applications in autonomous driving, medical imaging, and scene understanding.",
