Computer Vision Task: Image Segmentation

Model Name: Composable Fully-Convolutional Networks (CFN)

Model Architecture: Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) with Modular Composition

Description:
Composable Fully-Convolutional Networks (CFN) are designed for image segmentation tasks, offering a flexible and modular approach to constructing segmentation models. By leveraging fully convolutional networks, CFN allows for end-to-end learning and pixel-wise classification. The composable nature of CFN enables the integration of various network modules, such as different types of convolutions, pooling layers, and normalization techniques, to tailor the architecture to specific segmentation tasks. This flexibility makes CFN suitable for diverse applications, including medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite image analysis.

Metrics:
    - Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU): 80.5% (on a standard benchmark dataset)
    - Pixel Accuracy: 94.0%

Computational Time: 60-90 ms per image on NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU

Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
    - Hardware Requirements: GPU (NVIDIA Tesla V100 or similar recommended), CPU

Limitations:
    - Performance may vary depending on the choice and configuration of the network modules.
    - High computational and memory requirements for training, especially with complex configurations.
    - Requires a large and well-annotated dataset for optimal training and effective segmentation.
