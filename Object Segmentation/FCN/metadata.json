    "description": "Composable Fully-Convolutional Networks (CFN) are designed for image segmentation tasks, offering a flexible and modular approach to constructing segmentation models. By leveraging fully convolutional networks, CFN allows for end-to-end learning and pixel-wise classification. The composable nature of CFN enables the integration of various network modules, such as different types of convolutions, pooling layers, and normalization techniques, to tailor the architecture to specific segmentation tasks. This flexibility makes CFN suitable for diverse applications, including medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite image analysis.",
