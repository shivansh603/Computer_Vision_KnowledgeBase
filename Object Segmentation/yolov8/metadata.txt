Computer Vision Task: Object Segmentation

Model Name: YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) for Object Segmentation

Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Description:
YOLOv8 extends the capabilities of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series to include object segmentation. This model builds on the efficient object detection architecture of YOLOv8 by integrating segmentation heads that output pixel-wise masks for each detected object. YOLOv8 for Object Segmentation combines real-time detection speed with accurate segmentation, making it suitable for applications such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and video analysis.

Metrics:
    - Mean Average Precision (mAP) for segmentation: 50.0% (on COCO dataset at IoU=0.5)
    - Precision: 62.0%
    - Recall: 58.5%

Inference Time: 8 ms per image on NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU

Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: PyTorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Pillow, Matplotlib
    - Hardware Requirements: GPU (NVIDIA Tesla V100 or similar recommended), CPU

Limitations:
    - Performance may degrade when segmenting very small objects in high-resolution images.
    - Requires substantial computational resources for training, though inference is highly optimized.
    - May need fine-tuning and data augmentation for specific datasets to achieve optimal performance.
