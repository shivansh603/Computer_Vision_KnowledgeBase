Computer Vision Task: Object Segmentation

Model Name: YOLOv8s-Seg (You Only Look Once version 8 for Segmentation)

Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Description:
YOLOv8s-Seg is a real-time object detection and segmentation model that extends the YOLOv8 architecture with a segmentation head. It leverages the strengths of YOLOv8 in detecting objects and adds the capability to segment objects at the pixel level. The model uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes, class probabilities, and segmentation masks.

Metrics:
- Mean Average Precision (mAP) for segmentation: 36.8% (at IoU=0.5)

Inference Time: 11.8 ms per image on NVIDIA A100 GPU, 1.47 ms per image on CPU (ONNX)

Dependencies:
- Software Dependencies: PyTorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Pillow, Matplotlib
- Hardware Requirements: GPU (NVIDIA A100 or similar recommended), CPU

Limitations:
- Performance may degrade when segmenting very small objects in high-resolution images.
- Requires substantial computational resources for training, though inference is highly optimized.
- May need fine-tuning and data augmentation for specific datasets to achieve optimal performance.
