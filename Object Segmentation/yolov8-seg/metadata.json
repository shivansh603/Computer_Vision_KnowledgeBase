    "description": "YOLOv8s-Seg is a real-time object detection and segmentation model that extends the YOLOv8 architecture with a segmentation head. It leverages the strengths of YOLOv8 in detecting objects and adds the capability to segment objects at the pixel level. The model uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes, class probabilities, and segmentation masks.",
