Computer Vision Task: Object Detection and Segmentation
Model Name: YOLOv8m-seg
Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Description: YOLOv8m-seg is a medium-sized object detection and segmentation model, offering a balance between accuracy and speed. It is designed for deployment on devices with moderate computational resources, making it suitable for real-time object detection and segmentation tasks.
Metrics:

Accuracy (mAPbox 50-95): 49.9%
Accuracy (mAPmask 50-95): 40.8%
Inference Time: 317.0 ms per image on CPU (ONNX), 2.18 ms per image on A100 TensorRT
Model Size: 27.3M parameters, 110.2B FLOPs

Dependencies:

Software Dependencies: PyTorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Pillow
Hardware Requirements: GPU (A100 TensorRT recommended), CPU

Limitations:

May struggle with detecting very small or occluded objects.
Limited performance on complex scenes with many objects.
Requires moderate computational resources, making it less suitable for highly resource-constrained devices.
