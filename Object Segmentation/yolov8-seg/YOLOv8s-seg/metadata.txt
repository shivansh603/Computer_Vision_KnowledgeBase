Computer Vision Task: Object Detection and Segmentation
Model Name: YOLOv8s-seg
Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Description: YOLOv8s-seg is a small-sized object detection and segmentation model, offering a balance between accuracy and speed. It is designed for deployment on devices with moderate computational resources, making it suitable for real-time object detection and segmentation tasks.
Metrics:

Accuracy (mAPbox 50-95): 44.6%
Accuracy (mAPmask 50-95): 36.8%
Inference Time: 155.7 ms per image on CPU (ONNX), 1.47 ms per image on A100 TensorRT
Model Size: 11.8M parameters, 42.6B FLOPs

Dependencies:

Software Dependencies: PyTorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Pillow
Hardware Requirements: GPU (A100 TensorRT recommended), CPU

Limitations:

May struggle with detecting very small or occluded objects.
Limited performance on complex scenes with many objects.
Requires moderate computational resources, making it less suitable for highly resource-constrained devices.
