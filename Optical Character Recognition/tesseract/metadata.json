    "description": "PyTesseract is a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine. It enables easy integration of Tesseract OCR capabilities within Python scripts, allowing users to perform text extraction from images and scanned documents. Tesseract uses advanced image processing techniques and machine learning models to recognize text in various languages and formats. PyTesseract is widely used for document digitization, text extraction from images, and automated data entry tasks.",
