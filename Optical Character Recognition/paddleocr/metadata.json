    "description": "PaddleOCR is an open-source optical character recognition (OCR) framework developed by PaddlePaddle, an AI platform from Baidu. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and pre-trained models for text detection, recognition, and layout analysis in images and documents. PaddleOCR leverages deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to achieve high accuracy in text extraction and recognition tasks. It supports multiple languages, various text orientations, and can handle complex scenarios such as scene text, handwritten text, and document analysis.",
