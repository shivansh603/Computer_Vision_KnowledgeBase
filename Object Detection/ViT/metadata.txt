Computer Vision Task: Object Detection

Model Name: Vision Transformer (ViT) for Object Detection

Model Architecture: Transformer-based Neural Network

Description:
Vision Transformer (ViT) for Object Detection leverages the transformer architecture, originally designed for image classification, and adapts it for detecting objects within images. This model divides an image into patches, processes them as sequences, and uses the attention mechanism to capture spatial relationships and context. When fine-tuned for object detection tasks, ViT can provide robust performance in identifying and localizing objects across various scales and complexities. This model is particularly effective for applications in autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics.

Metrics:
    - Mean Average Precision (mAP): 47.1% (on COCO dataset)
    - Precision: 63.5%
    - Recall: 60.2%

Inference Time: 100 ms per image on NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU

Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy
    - Hardware Requirements: GPU (NVIDIA Tesla V100 or similar recommended), CPU

Limitations:
    - High computational and memory requirements for training and inference.
    - May require extensive fine-tuning and a large dataset to achieve optimal performance.
    - Performance can be sensitive to the choice of patch size and transformer hyperparameters.
