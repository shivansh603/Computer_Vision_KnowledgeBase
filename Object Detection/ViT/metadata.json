    "description": "Vision Transformer (ViT) for Object Detection leverages the transformer architecture, originally designed for image classification, and adapts it for detecting objects within images. This model divides an image into patches, processes them as sequences, and uses the attention mechanism to capture spatial relationships and context. When fine-tuned for object detection tasks, ViT can provide robust performance in identifying and localizing objects across various scales and complexities. This model is particularly effective for applications in autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics.",
