    "model_name": "Contour-Based Object Detection",
    "description": "Contour-Based Object Detection is a classical computer vision approach that identifies objects within an image by detecting their contours or edges. This method relies on identifying the boundaries of objects based on abrupt changes in pixel intensity, using techniques such as edge detection, contour finding, and shape analysis. Contour-based methods are particularly effective for detecting objects with well-defined edges and are widely used in applications like shape recognition, industrial inspection, and medical imaging.",
