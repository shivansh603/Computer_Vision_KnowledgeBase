Computer Vision Task: Object Detection
Model Name: YOLOv8s

Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Description: YOLOv8s is a small and efficient object detection model, designed for deployment on resource-constrained devices. It provides a good balance between accuracy and speed, making it suitable for real-time object detection tasks.

Metrics:

Accuracy (mAPval 50-95): 44.9%
Inference Time:
128.4 ms per image on CPU (ONNX)
1.20 ms per image on A100 TensorRT
Model Size: 11.2M parameters, 28.6B FLOPs
Dependencies:

Software Dependencies: PyTorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Pillow
Hardware Requirements: GPU (A100 TensorRT recommended), CPU
Limitations:

Lower accuracy compared to larger YOLOv8 models due to the trade-off for smaller model size.
May struggle with detecting very small or occluded objects.
Limited performance on complex scenes with many objects.
