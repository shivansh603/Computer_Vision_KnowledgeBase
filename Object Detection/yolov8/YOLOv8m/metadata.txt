Computer Vision Task: Object Detection
Model Name: YOLOv8m

Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Description: YOLOv8m is a medium-sized object detection model that offers a balance between accuracy and speed. It is designed for deployment on a range of devices, from resource-constrained to more powerful systems. Its performance makes it suitable for a wide variety of real-time object detection applications.

Metrics:

Accuracy (mAPval 50-95): 50.2%
Inference Time:
234.7 ms per image on CPU (ONNX)
1.83 ms per image on A100 TensorRT
Model Size: 25.9M parameters, 78.9B FLOPs
Dependencies:

Software Dependencies: PyTorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Pillow
Hardware Requirements: GPU (A100 TensorRT recommended), CPU
Limitations:

Lower accuracy compared to larger YOLOv8 models due to the trade-off for moderate model size.
May struggle with detecting very small or occluded objects in highly complex scenes.
