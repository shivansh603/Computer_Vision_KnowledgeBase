Computer Vision Task: Object Detection
Model Name: YOLOv8l

Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Description: YOLOv8l is a large object detection model, offering a strong balance between accuracy and computational requirements. It is designed for deployment on systems with moderate to high computational resources, making it suitable for applications needing high precision in object detection without the extreme demands of the largest models.

Metrics:

Accuracy (mAPval 50-95): 52.9%
Inference Time:
375.2 ms per image on CPU (ONNX)
2.39 ms per image on A100 TensorRT
Model Size: 43.7M parameters, 165.2B FLOPs
Dependencies:

Software Dependencies: PyTorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Pillow
Hardware Requirements: GPU (A100 TensorRT recommended), CPU
Limitations:

Higher computational and memory requirements compared to smaller YOLOv8 models.
Less suitable for deployment on highly resource-constrained devices.
Increased inference time on less powerful hardware.
