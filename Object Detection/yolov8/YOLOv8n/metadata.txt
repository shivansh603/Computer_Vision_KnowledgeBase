Computer Vision Task: Object Detection and Segmentation
Model Name: YOLOv8n-seg
Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Description: YOLOv8n-seg is a compact and efficient object detection and segmentation model, designed for deployment on resource-constrained devices. It offers a balance between accuracy and speed, making it suitable for real-time object detection and segmentation tasks.
Metrics:

Accuracy (mAPbox 50-95): 36.7%
Accuracy (mAPmask 50-95): 30.5%
Inference Time: 96.1 ms per image on CPU (ONNX), 1.21 ms per image on A100 TensorRT
Model Size: 12.6M parameters, 3.4B FLOPs

Dependencies:

Software Dependencies: PyTorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Pillow
Hardware Requirements: GPU (A100 TensorRT recommended), CPU

Limitations:

Lower accuracy compared to larger YOLOv8 models due to the trade-off for smaller model size.
May struggle with detecting very small or occluded objects.
Limited performance on complex scenes with many objects.
