Computer Vision Task: Object Detection
Model Name: YOLOv8n

Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Description: YOLOv8n is a nano-sized, highly efficient object detection model designed for deployment on highly resource-constrained devices. It offers a significant trade-off between speed and accuracy, making it ideal for real-time applications where computational resources are limited.

Metrics:

Accuracy (mAPval 50-95): 37.3%
Inference Time:
80.4 ms per image on CPU (ONNX)
0.99 ms per image on A100 TensorRT
Model Size: 3.2M parameters, 8.7B FLOPs
Dependencies:

Software Dependencies: PyTorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Pillow
Hardware Requirements: GPU (A100 TensorRT recommended), CPU
Limitations:

Lower accuracy compared to larger YOLOv8 models due to the trade-off for a smaller model size.
May struggle with detecting very small or occluded objects.
Limited performance on complex scenes with many objects.
