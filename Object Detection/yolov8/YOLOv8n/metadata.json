        "hardware_requirements": "GPU (A100 TensorRT recommended), CPU"
    },
    "limitations": "Lower accuracy compared to larger YOLOv8 models due to the trade-off for a smaller model size.\nMay struggle with detecting very small or occluded objects.\nLimited performance on complex scenes with many objects.",
