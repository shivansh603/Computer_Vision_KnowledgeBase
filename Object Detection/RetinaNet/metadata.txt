Computer Vision Task: Object Detection

Model Name: RetinaNet

Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Focal Loss

Description:
RetinaNet is a state-of-the-art object detection model designed to address the class imbalance problem encountered during training. It uses a convolutional neural network backbone (e.g., ResNet) along with a feature pyramid network (FPN) to efficiently detect objects at different scales. RetinaNet introduces the novel focal loss function, which down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples, focusing more on hard, misclassified examples. This results in superior performance, especially for detecting smaller objects in cluttered scenes.

Metrics:
    - Mean Average Precision (mAP): 39.1% (on COCO dataset)
    - Precision: 55.4%
    - Recall: 52.8%

Inference Time: 70 ms per image on NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU

Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy
    - Hardware Requirements: GPU (NVIDIA Tesla V100 or similar recommended), CPU

Limitations:
    - High computational and memory requirements for training and inference.
    - Performance can be sensitive to the choice of anchor boxes and their configurations.
    - Requires a large labeled dataset for optimal performance and effective training.
