    "description": "RetinaNet is a state-of-the-art object detection model designed to address the class imbalance problem encountered during training. It uses a convolutional neural network backbone (e.g., ResNet) along with a feature pyramid network (FPN) to efficiently detect objects at different scales. RetinaNet introduces the novel focal loss function, which down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples, focusing more on hard, misclassified examples. This results in superior performance, especially for detecting smaller objects in cluttered scenes.",
