    "description": "YOLOv5s is a small version of the YOLOv5 object detection model, offering a balance between model size and performance. It is suitable for deployment on devices with limited computational resources, such as embedded systems and mobile devices, while providing higher accuracy compared to the YOLOv5n model.",

        "precision": "",
        "recall": "",
        "accuracy": "37.4% (on COCO val2017 dataset)",
        "inference_time": "3.6 ms per image on NVIDIA V100"
