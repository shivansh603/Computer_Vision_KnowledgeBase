Model Name: YOLOv5m

Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Description:
YOLOv5m (You Only Look Once version 5 Medium) is a medium-sized variant of the YOLOv5 object detection model, striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. It is capable of detecting multiple objects in an image with high accuracy and moderate inference speed. YOLOv5m is suitable for applications requiring a compromise between the real-time performance of lighter models and the high accuracy of larger models, such as real-time surveillance, autonomous driving, and detailed image analysis.

Metrics:

    - Accuracy (mAP): 51.5% (mean Average Precision at IoU=0.5)
    - Precision: 56.8%
    - Recall: 54.1%
    - F1 Score: 55.4%
    - Inference Time: 8 ms per image on NVIDIA V100

Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: PyTorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Pillow, Matplotlib
    - Hardware Requirements: GPU (NVIDIA V100 or similar recommended), CPU for inference with reduced performance

Limitations:

    - The model may struggle with detecting very small objects in high-resolution images.
    - Performance may degrade in cases of heavy occlusion or overlapping objects.
    - Requires a GPU for optimal performance and near real-time inference.
