    "description": "YOLOv5m is the medium-sized version of the YOLOv5 object detection model, offering a balance between model size, performance, and accuracy. It is suitable for deployment on devices with moderate computational resources, such as desktop computers and edge servers, providing higher accuracy compared to the smaller YOLOv5 models.",
