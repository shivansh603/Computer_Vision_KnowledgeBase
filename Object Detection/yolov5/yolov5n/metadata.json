    "description": "YOLOv5n is the smallest and most lightweight version of the YOLOv5 object detection model. It is designed for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones, embedded systems, and edge devices. Despite its compact size, YOLOv5n offers reasonable performance for real-time object detection tasks.",
