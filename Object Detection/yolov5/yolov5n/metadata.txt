Computer Vision Task: Object Detection

Model Name: YOLOv5

Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Description:
YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) is a state-of-the-art object detection model designed for real-time applications. It is capable of detecting multiple objects in an image with high accuracy and speed. YOLOv5 can be used in various applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and image analysis.

Metrics:

    - Accuracy (mAP): 50.5% (mean Average Precision at IoU=0.5)
    - Precision: 55.3%
    - Recall: 52.5%
    - F1 Score: 53.9%
    - Inference Time: 5 ms per image on NVIDIA V100

Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: PyTorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Pillow, Matplotlib
    - Hardware Requirements: GPU (NVIDIA V100 or similar recommended), CPU
    
Limitations:

    - The model may struggle with detecting very small objects in high-resolution images.
    - Performance may degrade in cases of heavy occlusion or overlapping objects.
    - Requires a GPU for optimal performance and real-time inference.
