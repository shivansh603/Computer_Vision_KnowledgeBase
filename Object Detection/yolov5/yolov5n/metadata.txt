Computer Vision Task: Object Detection
Model Name: YOLOv5n (Nano)
Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Description: YOLOv5n is the smallest and most lightweight version of the YOLOv5 object detection model. It is designed for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones, embedded systems, and edge devices. Despite its compact size, YOLOv5n offers reasonable performance for real-time object detection tasks.
Metrics:

Accuracy (mAP@0.5): 28.0% (on COCO val2017 dataset)
Inference Time: 1.3 ms per image on NVIDIA V100

Dependencies:

Software Dependencies: PyTorch, OpenCV, Numpy, Pillow
Hardware Requirements: GPU (NVIDIA V100 or similar recommended), CPU

Limitations:

Lower accuracy compared to larger YOLOv5 models due to the trade-off for smaller model size.
May struggle with detecting very small or occluded objects.
Limited performance on complex scenes with many objects.
