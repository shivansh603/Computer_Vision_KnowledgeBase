    "description": "Image Deconvolution is a technique used in image processing to reverse the effects of blurring and recover the original image. Blurring can occur due to various factors, such as camera motion, defocus, or atmospheric disturbance. Deconvolution algorithms aim to estimate the original image by mitigating the blur effect, enhancing the sharpness and clarity of the image. This technique is crucial in fields such as astronomy, microscopy, and medical imaging, where image clarity is paramount.",
