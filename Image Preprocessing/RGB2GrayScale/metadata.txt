Computer Vision Task: Image Conversion
Model Name: Grayscale Conversion
Model Architecture: N/A (Direct pixel value conversion)
Description:
Grayscale conversion is a technique that transforms a color image into an image containing only shades of gray. This process involves discarding color information from each pixel and assigning a single intensity value based on a weighted combination of the original color channels. Grayscale conversion is a fundamental operation in computer vision and has various applications, including image processing, pattern recognition, and image analysis.
Metrics:
    - N/A (Grayscale conversion does not aim to improve image quality; it alters the color space)
Computational Time: 1 ms per image on standard CPU
Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: OpenCV
    - Hardware Requirements: CPU
Limitations:
   - Loss of color information, which can be crucial for tasks requiring color analysis.
   - Grayscale images may contain less information compared to their color counterparts, potentially affecting subsequent processing steps.
