    "model_name": "Grayscale Conversion",
    "description": "Grayscale conversion is a technique that transforms a color image into an image containing only shades of gray. This process involves discarding color information from each pixel and assigning a single intensity value based on a weighted combination of the original color channels. Grayscale conversion is a fundamental operation in computer vision and has various applications, including image processing, pattern recognition, and image analysis.",
