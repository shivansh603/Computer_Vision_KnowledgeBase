    "name": "Pose Estimation",
    "description": "Pose estimation is a computer vision technique used to infer the spatial configuration of objects or human bodies in images or videos. It is crucial in applications such as augmented reality, human-computer interaction, and sports analytics. Pose estimation algorithms analyze the positions and orientations of key points or joints to reconstruct the pose of objects or humans. Popular methods include single-person pose estimation (e.g., OpenPose), multi-person pose estimation (e.g., AlphaPose), and deep learning-based approaches such as Convolutional Pose Machines (CPM) and PoseNet. ",
    "usecase": "Used in human-computer interaction, motion capture, and sports analytics.",
    "challenges": "Challenges include occlusions, complex poses, and varying viewpoints.",
    "popular_methods": "Common methods include deep learning-based approaches, such as Convolutional Pose Machines (CPM) and OpenPose."
