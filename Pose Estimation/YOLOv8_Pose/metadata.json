    "description": "YOLOv8 extends the capabilities of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series to include pose estimation. This model builds on the efficient object detection architecture of YOLOv8 by integrating pose estimation heads that output keypoint locations for detected objects. YOLOv8 for Pose Estimation combines real-time detection speed with accurate keypoint localization, making it suitable for applications such as human pose estimation, sports analytics, and interactive systems.",
