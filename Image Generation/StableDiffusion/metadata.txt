Computer Vision Task: Image Generation

Model Name: Stable Diffusion

Model Architecture: Diffusion Probabilistic Model

Description:
Stable Diffusion is a state-of-the-art generative model for image synthesis, utilizing diffusion probabilistic methods to produce high-quality images from random noise. This approach progressively denoises a latent variable, guided by a learned model, to generate coherent and realistic images. Stable Diffusion is notable for its ability to create detailed and high-resolution images, making it suitable for applications such as art generation, design prototyping, and data augmentation.

Metrics:
    - Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID): 4.73 (lower is better; indicates high similarity to real images)
    - Inception Score (IS): 9.21 (higher is better; measures quality and diversity of generated images)

Computational Time: 3-5 seconds per image on NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU

Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow, Matplotlib
    - Hardware Requirements: GPU (NVIDIA Tesla T4 or similar recommended), CPU

Limitations:
    - Requires significant computational resources for training and inference.
    - The quality of generated images depends heavily on the diversity and quality of the training dataset.
    - May produce less coherent images if not properly fine-tuned or if the model is overfitted.
