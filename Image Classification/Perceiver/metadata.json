    "description": "The Perceiver model is a general-purpose neural network architecture designed to process various types of input data, including images, audio, and video. It addresses the limitations of traditional transformers in handling high-dimensional data by introducing a scalable attention mechanism. The Perceiver efficiently processes large inputs by mapping them to a smaller latent space, allowing the model to capture both local and global context. This makes it suitable for high-performance image classification tasks.",
