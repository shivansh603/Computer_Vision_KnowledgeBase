    "description": "External Attention Transformer (EAT) is an innovative neural network architecture that incorporates external attention mechanisms into the Transformer model for image classification tasks. Unlike traditional self-attention mechanisms, EAT utilizes external features to attend to relevant regions in the input image, enabling the model to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information effectively. EAT achieves superior performance on a wide range of image classification benchmarks by leveraging both local and global context.",
