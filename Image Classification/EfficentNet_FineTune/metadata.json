    "description": "EfficientNet is a family of convolutional neural network architectures that achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. These models are based on a novel compound scaling method that uniformly scales network width, depth, and resolution. By balancing model complexity and computational cost, EfficientNet achieves remarkable accuracy with significantly fewer parameters compared to other architectures.",
