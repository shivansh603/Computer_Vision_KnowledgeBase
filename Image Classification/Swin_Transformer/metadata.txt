Computer Vision Task: Image Classification

Model Name: Swin Transformer

Model Architecture: Hierarchical Transformer with Shifted Windows

Description:
Swin Transformer (Shifted Window Transformer) is a cutting-edge neural network architecture designed for image classification and other vision tasks. It introduces a hierarchical structure with shifted windows, which allows for efficient computation while capturing fine-grained and global image features. By partitioning images into non-overlapping local windows and shifting the windows at different layers, Swin Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, outperforming traditional CNNs and other transformer-based models in capturing both local and global context.

    - Top-1 Accuracy: 87.3% (on ImageNet-1K)
    - Top-5 Accuracy: 98.0% (on ImageNet-1K)
    - Precision: 87.0%
    - Recall: 86.8%
    - F1 Score: 86.9%

Inference Time: 10 ms per image on NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU

Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow, Matplotlib
    - Hardware Requirements: GPU (NVIDIA Tesla T4 or similar recommended), CPU

Limitations:
    - Performance may degrade on datasets with extremely small or highly overlapping objects.
