    "description": "Swin Transformer (Shifted Window Transformer) is a cutting-edge neural network architecture designed for image classification and other vision tasks. It introduces a hierarchical structure with shifted windows, which allows for efficient computation while capturing fine-grained and global image features. By partitioning images into non-overlapping local windows and shifting the windows at different layers, Swin Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, outperforming traditional CNNs and other transformer-based models in capturing both local and global context.",
