    "description": "SimCLR (Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations) is a state-of-the-art self-supervised learning algorithm designed for image classification. By maximizing the agreement between differently augmented views of the same data, SimCLR learns robust image representations without requiring labeled data. This model is effective for various downstream tasks, such as object detection and image segmentation, making it suitable for applications in medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, and general visual understanding.",
    "metrics": {
        "accuracy": "68.4% (on ImageNet top-1 classification with linear evaluation)",
        "training_time": "Varies depending on the dataset and hardware, typically requires several days on a high-end GPU cluster.",
        "inference_time": "15 ms per image on NVIDIA V100 (after pretraining)"
