    "description": "The model is a small version of the Xception network, designed for the binary classification task of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. It consists of an entry block with a convolutional layer, batch normalization, and ReLU activation, followed by a series of separable convolutional blocks with residual connections. The final block is followed by a global average pooling layer, dropout, and a dense output layer with a single unit for binary classification.",
    "metrics": {
        "binary_accuracy": ">90% (on validation set after 25 epochs)"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "software_dependencies": "Keras, TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib",
        "hardware_requirements": "GPU (recommended for faster training)"
    },
    "limitations": "- The model is designed specifically for the Cats vs Dogs binary classification task and may require architectural changes for other classification tasks or datasets.\n- Performance may degrade on more complex or diverse datasets.\n- The model's performance is dependent on the quality and diversity of the training data.",
