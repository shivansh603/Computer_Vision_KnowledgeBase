Model Name: Image Classification from Scratch
Model Architecture: Custom deep convolutional neural network based on Xception architecture
Architecture Description: The model is a small version of the Xception network, designed for the binary classification task of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. It consists of an entry block with a convolutional layer, batch normalization, and ReLU activation, followed by a series of separable convolutional blocks with residual connections. The final block is followed by a global average pooling layer, dropout, and a dense output layer with a single unit for binary classification.
Metrics:

Binary Accuracy: >90% (on validation set after 25 epochs)

Dependencies:

Software Dependencies: Keras, TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib
Hardware Requirements: GPU (recommended for faster training)

Limitations:

The model is designed specifically for the Cats vs Dogs binary classification task and may require architectural changes for other classification tasks or datasets.
Performance may degrade on more complex or diverse datasets.
The model's performance is dependent on the quality and diversity of the training data.
