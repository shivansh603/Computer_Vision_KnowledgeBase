    "description": "ConvMixer is a novel architecture that combines convolutional layers with Mixer blocks to achieve strong performance on image classification tasks. Unlike traditional CNNs that rely solely on convolutional layers, ConvMixer introduces Mixer blocks, which consist of channel-wise and spatial-wise mixing operations. This architecture enables ConvMixer to effectively capture both local and global features in images, leading to improved classification accuracy.",
