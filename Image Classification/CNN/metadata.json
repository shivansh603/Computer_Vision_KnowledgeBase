    "description": "The Simple CNN model is a straightforward convolutional neural network designed for basic image classification tasks. It consists of a series of convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, and fully connected layers, making it suitable for small to medium-sized datasets. This model is easy to implement and serves as a foundational approach for learning and experimenting with CNN architectures.",
