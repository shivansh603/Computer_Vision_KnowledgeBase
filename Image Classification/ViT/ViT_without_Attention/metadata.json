    "description": "This subfolder likely contains implementations of the Vision Transformer architecture without the self-attention mechanism. The self-attention mechanism is a key component of the transformer architecture, responsible for capturing long-range dependencies. However, some research has explored alternative approaches to model long-range dependencies in ViT without explicit self-attention layers, potentially improving efficiency or providing different inductive biases.",
