Computer Vision Task: Image Classification

Model Name: Vision Transformer (ViT)

Model Architecture: Transformer-based Neural Network

Description:
Vision Transformer (ViT) is a pioneering neural network architecture that applies transformer models to image classification tasks. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViT divides an image into fixed-size patches and processes them as a sequence of tokens, similar to how transformers process words in NLP tasks. This approach allows ViT to capture long-range dependencies and global context effectively, leading to state-of-the-art performance on various image classification benchmarks.

Metrics:
    - Top-1 Accuracy: 85.5% (on ImageNet-1K)
    - Top-5 Accuracy: 97.2% (on ImageNet-1K)
    - Precision: 85.2%
    - Recall: 85.0%
    - F1 Score: 85.1%

Inference Time: 12 ms per image on NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU

Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow, Matplotlib
    - Hardware Requirements: GPU (NVIDIA Tesla T4 or similar recommended), CPU

Limitations:
    - Requires a large amount of data for pretraining to achieve optimal performance.
    - Computationally intensive, necessitating powerful GPUs for efficient training and inference.
    - Performance can be sensitive to the choice of patch size and other hyperparameters.
    - May require fine-tuning on specific datasets to achieve the best results.
