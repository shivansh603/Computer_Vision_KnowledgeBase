    "description": "Vision Transformer (ViT) is a pioneering neural network architecture that applies transformer models to image classification tasks. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViT divides an image into fixed-size patches and processes them as a sequence of tokens, similar to how transformers process words in NLP tasks. This approach allows ViT to capture long-range dependencies and global context effectively, leading to state-of-the-art performance on various image classification benchmarks.",
