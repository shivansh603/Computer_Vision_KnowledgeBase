    "description": "MobileViT is an efficient variant of the Vision Transformer architecture, designed for mobile and resource-constrained devices. It introduces a novel attention mechanism that combines the strengths of Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). MobileViT replaces the standard multi-head self-attention blocks with lightweight inverted residual blocks, which significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining the long-range dependency modeling capabilities of Transformers.",
