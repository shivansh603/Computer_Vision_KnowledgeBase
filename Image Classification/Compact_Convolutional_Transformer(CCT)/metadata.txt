Computer Vision Task: Image Classification

Model Name: Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCT)

Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Transformer blocks

Description:
Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCT) combine the efficiency of convolutional layers with the expressive power of Transformer blocks. This architecture is specifically designed to achieve strong performance on image classification tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. By integrating self-attention mechanisms from Transformers, CCT can capture long-range dependencies in images and effectively model spatial relationships.
