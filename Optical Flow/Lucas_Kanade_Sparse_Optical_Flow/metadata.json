    "description": "The Lucas-Kanade Sparse Optical Flow algorithm is used to estimate the motion of a sparse set of feature points between consecutive frames in a video sequence. It works by assuming that the flow is essentially constant in a local neighborhood of the pixel under consideration, and uses a least squares approach to solve for the optical flow vectors. This method is highly efficient and suitable for applications like feature tracking, video stabilization, and motion analysis where only a sparse set of key points is required.",
