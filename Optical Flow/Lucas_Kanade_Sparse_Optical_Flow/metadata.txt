Computer Vision Task: Optical Flow

Algorithm Name: Lucas-Kanade Sparse Optical Flow

Algorithm Type: Sparse Optical Flow Estimation

Description:
The Lucas-Kanade Sparse Optical Flow algorithm is used to estimate the motion of a sparse set of feature points between consecutive frames in a video sequence. It works by assuming that the flow is essentially constant in a local neighborhood of the pixel under consideration, and uses a least squares approach to solve for the optical flow vectors. This method is highly efficient and suitable for applications like feature tracking, video stabilization, and motion analysis where only a sparse set of key points is required.

Metrics:
    Flow Accuracy: High for small displacements and well-textured regions.

Computational Time: 10-30 ms per frame on a standard CPU (timing can vary based on the number of points and resolution).

Dependencies:
    - Software Dependencies: OpenCV, NumPy
    - Hardware Requirements: CPU (GPU can be used to accelerate performance but is not essential)

Limitations:
    - Performance can degrade with large displacements, rapid motion, or in areas with little texture.
    - Sensitive to noise and lighting variations.
    - Requires good feature points for optimal performance (e.g., corners detected by Harris or Shi-Tomasi methods).
