    "description": "The Gunnar Farneback Dense Optical Flow algorithm is designed to estimate the motion of each pixel between consecutive frames in a video sequence. This method uses polynomial expansion to approximate the pixel intensities and computes the displacement field for every pixel, providing a dense flow map. It is highly effective for applications requiring precise motion tracking, such as video stabilization, object tracking, and action recognition.",

        "precision": "",
        "recall": "",
        "accuracy": "Variable, depends on the dataset and the nature of the motion.",
