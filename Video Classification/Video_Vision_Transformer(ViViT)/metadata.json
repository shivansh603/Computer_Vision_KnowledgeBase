    "description": "The Video Vision Transformer (ViViT) model leverages the Transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing, for video classification tasks. ViViT processes video frames by dividing them into patches and embedding these patches into a sequence of tokens. The Transformer encoder then processes these tokens to capture spatial and temporal dependencies across frames. This architecture excels at capturing long-range dependencies and complex patterns in video data, making it suitable for applications such as action recognition, video summarization, and event detection.",
