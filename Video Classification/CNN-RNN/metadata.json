    "description": "The CNN-RNN model for video classification combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to effectively capture spatial and temporal features in video data. The CNN component extracts spatial features from individual video frames, while the RNN component (typically an LSTM or GRU) processes these features sequentially to capture temporal dependencies. This hybrid architecture is well-suited for tasks such as action recognition, video summarization, and event detection in video streams.",
